# Open-industrial-datasets
A collection of open datasets for industrial applications, divided by categories. PRs are welcome. Links to papers describing the datasets are only included if the dataset page doesn't link to the paper already

## Computer vision
A dataset of more than 19.400 X-ray images for the development, testing and evaluation of image analysis and computer vision algorithms

## Transportation Mode Detection
Especially interesting for [IIoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Internet_of_Things) applications, three theses and 1 paper already published about this project

## Dataset list
A big list of Machine Learning datasets. They're not necessarily related to industry application, but the list is very up-to-date, and it contains very large datasets which, through transfer learning, can help training models for industrial applications

## UK National Data Repository
The Data Repository of the UK Oil & Gas Authority, hosting a wealth of information about the UK Continental Shelf. Currently only a subset of the data is accessible to a wider public, but there are plans to extend the access also to the other data which are currently accessible only by petroleum licensee users.
