# Open-industrial-datasets
A collection of open datasets for industrial applications, divided by categories. PRs are welcome. Links to papers describing the datasets are only included if the dataset page doesn't link to the paper already

## Image processing

## Oil & Gas equipment
### Turbomachinery
https://github.com/siemens/industrialbenchmark [paper]()
https://www.openml.org/d/23383
### Boilers
https://www.openml.org/d/41170 (only the `.arff` file format is working at the moment)

## Open Industrial Dataset
The biggest data lake of open, continuously streaming industrial data
https://openindustrialdata.com/

## Transportation Mode Detection
Especially interesting for [IIoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Internet_of_Things) applications, three theses and 1 paper already published about this project

## Dataset list
A big list of Machine Learning datasets. They're not necessarily related to industry application, but the list is very up-to-date, and it contains very large datasets which, through transfer learning, can help training models for industrial applications
